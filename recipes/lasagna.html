        <h2>Description</h2>
       
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that's beloved around the world for its rich layers and comforting flavors. It's made by stacking wide, flat pasta sheets with a variety of fillings, typically including a savory mixture of ground meat (like beef or sausage), rich tomato sauce, and creamy b√©chamel or ricotta cheese. Often, the dish is also layered with grated mozzarella and Parmesan, which melt and brown beautifully during baking, creating a golden, bubbly top.</p>
        
        <p>Lasagna is typically baked in a large dish, allowing the flavors to meld together as the pasta absorbs the sauces, resulting in a hearty, satisfying meal. The beauty of lasagna lies in its versatility; it can be customized with various ingredients like spinach, mushrooms, or even eggplant for a vegetarian twist. Served hot and often paired with a side of garlic bread or a fresh salad, lasagna is a crowd-pleaser that works equally well for casual family dinners or festive gatherings.</p>
